The third week was spent focusing on different scenarios. Each group member had the same task, create two scenarios according to the example in the textbook & what makes people want to use CodeJudger.

<br><br>
<b>1st scenario: </b><br><br>
Josh is a teenager who has seen lots of movies about cool IT guys that can solve just about anything by making a simple code, so he decided it was time to take his programming skills to the next level. He finds an online code judger where he can practice coding with the right mixture of competition and fun. Once he logs in, he is asked what language he would like to work with. Below are displayed some choices. The first one a crash course section, then a ‘daily challenge’ , a tournament (consists of multiple sets of questions) and a forum. <br>
If he chooses crash course, he is redirected to a YouTube video depending on the language he has chosen.<br>
If he chooses daily challenge, he is on a timer from when he starts till he finishes the code. According to how fast or slow he solves the problem, he is ranked among other users who also chose to play the daily challenge.<br>
If he chooses the tournament, he is given the choice of the difficulty of the questions he would like to work on. After his decision, he is presented with a bunch of topics which lead to the questions. According to the amount of questions he solves, he gets a point for each right answer and becomes part of the competitors ranking.<br>
If he chooses the forum,  he can post a question which is public and anyone of the other users can interact w him to help .<br>

<br>
<b>2nd scenario: </b><br><br>
A freshman has just started uni and but he is not familiar with coding and it feels impossible to learn/ understand it, so he finds the code judger… the steps he then takes are same as the first one.

<br><br>
This was just an idea because the features may change considering on what we cooperatively decide as a group.

Second week's task assigned to me was listing existing implementations , name and features which we could use to inspire us for additional features on our project. So what I did was go to the sites that I previously had heard of and then searched for some more. There were a lot but I chose some that I liked better and took some notes. I tried to be brief and noted only the features I thought to be more important, they go as follows:

<br><br>
 <b> GeekForGeeks</b>
-website with lot of resources for programming but not just that.
 <br>
 Features: algorithms, interviews, students, quizzes.

<br><br>
 <b>HackerRank</b>
 -hiring platform for evaluating developer skils.
 <br>
 Features: coding practices,interview preparations.
 
<br><br>
 <b> Programmr</b>
-online interactive platform for learning and practicing coding.
 <br>
 Features: challenges, projects, contests, certificates.
 
<br><br>
 <b>CodeWars</b>
-platform where users work together to create challenges.
 <br>
 Features: Kata (coding practices), Kumite (1v1 challenges), forum, wiki.
 
<br><br>
 <b>CodeGym</b>
-for beginners to learn in Java.
 <br>
 Features: course, tasks, games, chat, forum.
 
 <br><br>

For the first week we were assigned to come up with different ideas for the project. I started my research by online searching, but most of the ideas seemed so repetitive and not that exciting. I also asked some friends that aren't related to the field what they would find useful. Considering both of these resources I suggested that we work on either of these ideas: online classroom platform or a game application.
