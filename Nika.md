Second week's task assigned to me was listing existing implementations , name and features which we could use to inspire us for additional features on our project. So what I did was go to the sites that I previously had heard of and then searched for some more. There were a lot but I chose some that I liked better and took some notes. I tried to be brief and noted only the features I thought to be more important, they go as follows:

<br><br>
 <b> GeekForGeeks</b>

For the first week we were assigned to come up with different ideas for the project. I started my research by online searching, but most of the ideas seemed so repetitive and not that exciting. I also asked some friends that aren't related to the field what they would find useful. Considering both of these resources I suggested that we work on either of these ideas: online classroom platform or a game application.
