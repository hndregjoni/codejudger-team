For the first week we were assigned to come up with different ideas for the project. I started my research by online searching, but most of the ideas seemed so repetitive and not that exciting. I also asked some friends that aren't related to the field what they would find useful. Considering both of these resources I suggested that we work on either of these ideas: online classroom platform or a game application.
