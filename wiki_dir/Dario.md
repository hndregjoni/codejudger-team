## Week 2:
During this week our leader split the task, mine being to listing features that would be appropriate for a project such as this. I looked into potential ideas by browsing through Code Judgers primarily ACM and LeetCode and some feautures I brainstormed that could be useful if we where able to implement on our project are:

**1. Questions categorized on Skill level:** 
Questions the users are to solve should be categorised in different skill levels i.e Beginner

**2. A way to sort questions in those categories:**
On top of questions being divided on different categories, on top of them we should also have a way to sort them for the conveinience of our users, this can be done with the implementation of a rating system, or success/fail ratio where the user can sort the questions from highest sucess rato or experienced users can go for the harder questions off the bat and sort based on the lowest sucess rate.

**3. Multiple Languages that the User can use:**
The more the merrier as they say. We need to take into account that different users are comfortable in different programming languages. Our Code Judger should be able to accurately judge answers based on different programming languages.

**4. A way for the user to leave/ask for feedback:**
Communication between developer and user is important, some times things don't go as planned, maybe the user got a right answer when they tested their code in their compiler but our Judger gave them a wrong score, if there is no way for this user to ask for feedback weather he did something wrong or that there is a mistake in our Judger we can risk driving that user away from our software. With a feedback system a user can also seek guidance from other users. A feedback system can easily be implemented by using public comments or creating forums.

**5. Daily chllanges:**
Daily challanges can be a good way to always ensure our users can have an "objective" to do. It's a good way to encourage daily participation.

## Week 1:
During first week, first interaction I had with the group was with our leader who invited me to our Whatsapp group (he was really nice about it).

I participated in both our online & offline meetings held on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. The main purpose behind these 2 meetings was deciding upon our topic for the project, a secondary objective was to discuss our skills and better coordinate the tasks between us. I interacted as much as I was able to, I put in project ideas, like making a Sorting Algorithm Visualization, in the end we all decided on building a Coding Judger based primarily on other Code Judger similar to ACM of Epoka or other Coding Judgers online such as Leet Code.
