Its features are Contests, Gym, Problem sets, Groups
<br> </br>
3. CodePen Challenges <br>
CodePen is a cool online IDE that allows you to write code in your browser and see the result just as you build it. CodePen challenges is a place for leveling up your skills by building things. Each week, new challenges appear for you to tackle, and the best “Pens” get picked.

We were all assigned to look for ideas for the project. My idea was to create a management system web application. It is a broad idea that we could all suggest different fields. After a discussion with the group during the meeting we agreed on codejudging application.
