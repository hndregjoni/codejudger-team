<br> <h1> WEEK 6 </h1>
In week 6 I was assigned to research security concerns regarding the execution of untrusted code. The most important concerns I found were : 
<br><h3> Data breaches.</h3> If other users are on the same server, and an attacker manages to read their data, you have a problem. If that data is confidential, you have an enormous problem.
</br>
<h3>Illegal activity.</h3> A server that allows arbitrary code is an invitation for shady things: your machine could be used to store offending data, hide communication, or, more likely, perform attacks on other targets.
<br>
<h3>Network integrity.</h3> Allowing arbitrary code execution means users can initiate and accept network connections from your server, and depending on your network configuration, this may allow them to access things inside your network that aren't supposed to be reachable from the outside.
</br>
<br>
<h3>System resources (DoS).</h3> If you allow arbitrary code execution on your systems, then it is easy to deplete system resources on that machine, on purpose, or by accident. Writing code that fills the entire HDD with garbage is easy, preventing it without severely crippling the system is much harder. The same goes for other system resources, such as CPU cycles, RAM, network bandwidth, etc.
</br>
<h3>How Technologies like Docker and seccomp reduce the risk. </h3>
<h5> Docker </h5>
Applications running in containers can be deployed easily to multiple different operating systems and hardware platforms. DevOps teams know applications in containers will run the same, regardless of where they are deployed. Containers allow applications to be more rapidly deployed, patched, or scaled.
<h5> seccomp </h5>
Secure computing mode ( seccomp ) is a Linux kernel feature. You can use it to restrict the actions available within the container. The seccomp() system call operates on the seccomp state of the calling process. You can use this feature to restrict your application's access.

<br> <h1> WEEK 4 </h1>
Week 4 objective was to provide exercises of different difficulty levels and different programming languages. I also provided their solutions which I tested myself. I started with Java programming.

Week 3 objective was to create use cases/scenarios for the web application. Each group member should come up with 2 scenarios.
<br>
1. John studies computer science. He wishes to practice and to exercise coding.
<br>
2. Tom was challenged by his group of friends to make a small game like sudoku etc. He searched on the web on how to improve his programming skills.

<br> </br>
For the second week, two other members and I were assigned to find existing implementations related to the chosen topic. Some of the implementations I found are : 
1. HackerEarth <br>
HackerEarth is a popular coding platform that features questions, challenges, and hackathons. It is also trusted by hiring managers across companies. This platform has a thriving community of 3 million developers.
<br> </br>
2. CodeForces <br>
Its features are Contests, Gym, Problem sets, Groups
<br> </br>
3. CodePen Challenges <br>
CodePen is a cool online IDE that allows you to write code in your browser and see the result just as you build it. CodePen challenge is a place for leveling up your skills by building things. Each week, new challenges appear for you to tackle, and the best “Pens” get picked.
<br> </br>
4. CodinGame <br>
CodinGame's goal is to let programmers keep on improving their coding skills by solving the world’s most challenging problems, learn new concepts, and get inspired by the best developers.

We were all assigned to look for ideas for the project. My idea was to create a management system web application. It is a broad idea that we could all suggest different fields. After a discussion with the group during the meeting, we agreed on codejudging application.
