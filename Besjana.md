# Student wiki: Besjana

##  Week 1 
This week we were supposed to come up with ideas for the project.

The ideas I gave as possible project topics were :  
-   public transportation management system 
-   game 


Another thing that I did this week was deciding on a leader for our group :  
And our leader is  (drumrolls 👏 🔥) Hysen !!!  

We also talked about the initial division of roles :  
I volunteered to participate in the database design, since most people were keen on taking on the frontend part.  

A whatsapp group was opened for the little details, such as the usual meeting time or different useful links to be shared, and I participated to make the communication easier.

We have our repo (I mean this wiki is on github), where we post everything related to the progress of our work.
We were also encouraged to look into markdown and mermaid (diagram tool) for smoother documentation process.
All in all, that is what I did this week.
