# Week 2
This other week I prepared the repositories to be used. The idea is to separate the main repository which will host the implementation in the coming weeks, from the repository which will contain the material required by the course.
The repos are:
1. [codejudger](https://github.com/hndregjoni/codejudger)
2. [codejudger-team](https://github.com/hndregjoni/codejudger-team/)

Links to resources to learn the new tools were shared by me in the group chat (for git, Markdown and Mermaid). As for the tasks, they were a bit more diversified this week. We were separated in two groups, with the following tasks:
1. Listing existing solutions to the problem we chose: Besjana, Nika, Luis.
2. Listing features that we would think belong to such an application: Hysen, Dario, Inis

My conclusion to the task was as follows (a rough initial sketch):

> The application will be a platform that allows for code competitions, and coding problem evaluation. The basic idea is to have a collection of problems, which will be curated by specific users of the system. These problems might have other additional attributes to them, which might allow for more flexible organization of problems (i.e. courses, timed events, etc.).<br>
> Users should be allowed to solve the problems in a language they choose, and the range of choices should be decently large. It would be good if a point system was also in place.

# Week 1
In this first week I was acquainted with the team. We decided upon a leader, and that ended up being me. As a first thing, we created a means of communication (WhatsApp group), and the members were invited (after some hoops had to be jumped through).

After that, an online meeting was commenced on Tuesday. We briefly went through what the project meant, and what we would potentially be dealing with eventually. One thing we agreed upon was that one good takeway from this project would be the bulk of methodologies and diagramming techniques we would be learning. For that reason, we decided that we would all participate in filling this documentation, even though only some of us would actively participate in the implementation.

The main task for the week, for everyone, was to suggest topics for the project. The ones I suggested were:
1. A code judging system.
2. A billing system.

The first idea was decided.

We also set some ground rules as to the participation in the future weeks. No technologies were decided this week, but we went over the capabilities of the team. They were generally within the confines of what we did at university.
