# Week 1
In this first week I was acquainted with the team. We decided upon a leader, and that ended up being me. As a first thing, we created a means of communication (WhatsApp group), and the members were invited (after some hoops had to be jumped through).

After that, an online meeting was commenced on Tuesday. We briefly went through what the project meant, and what we would potentially be dealing with eventually. One thing we agreed upon was that one good takeway from this project would be the bulk of methodologies and diagramming techniques we would be learning. For that reason, we decided that we would all participate in filling this documentation, even though only some of us would actively participate in the implementation.

The main task for the week, for everyone, was to suggest topics for the project. The ones I suggested were:
1. A code judging system.
2. A billing system.

The first idea was decided.

We also set some ground rules as to the participation in the future weeks. No technologies were decided this week, but we went over the capabilities of the team. They were generally within the confines of what we did at university.
