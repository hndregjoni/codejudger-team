Second week's task assigned to me was listing existing implementations , name and features which we could use to inspire us for additional features on our project. So what I did was go to the sites that I previously had heard of and then searched for some more. There were a lot but I chose some that I liked better and took some notes. I tried to be brief and noted only the features I thought to be more important, they go as follows:
