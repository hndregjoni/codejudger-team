\section{Product/Service Description}

This project is primarily organized as a web service. The interface is to be served via the browser (API endpoints is available to facilitate further mediums). As hinted, one primary aspect of the system will be the 
backend server, serving the API.

The architecture of the system is to be monolithic, with some specific cases where a granular approach is chosen to enable for a more appropriate seperation of the domains. This is exemplified in the
fact that there will be a database server, a caching server, and also the novel judging servers. The latter are the more pertinent example. Their existence assures a more horizontally scalable approach to answer validation and code
running, as well as a more isolated environment for the execution of the code, which greatly limits potential attack surfaces for the system.

The components are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Gateway
    \item Backend server
    \item Frontend server
    \item Database server
    \item Cache server
    \item Judge servers
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assumptions}
This product is to be developed on a certain number of technical prerequisites. The toolstack is described as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Host OS}: \textbf{Linux} as a first class citizien.
    \item \textit{Container platform}: \textbf{Docker} utilized extensively.
    \item \textit{Protocol}: \textbf{HTTP} is the main communication protocol
    \item \textit{Backend}: \textbf{Python} running \textbf{FastAPI} and several other tools
    \item \textit{Frontend}: \textbf{Javascript} with \textbf{Nuxt.js}, \textbf{Vue}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Time}: An MVP is sought, within the time constraints.
    \item \textbf{Migration} from existing systems via different scripts, as a possible action to be performed post-development.
    \item \textbf{Clarity}: The technologies used should neither be too obscure, nor too ineffective.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Dependencies}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Continuous} monitoring of the health of the Judger servers.
    \item \textit{Continuous} removal of items hogging up the system (i.e. old notifications)
    \item \textit{Backcompatibility} with older definitions of what constitutes a problem, to allow for migration.
\end{enumerate}
