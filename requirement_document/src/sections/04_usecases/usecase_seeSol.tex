UC Name & UC\_See\_solution \\ \hline

Summary &  See others solutions and ranking \\ \hline

Dependency & This optional section describes whether the UC depends on other UCs. \\ \hline

Actors & Primarily this use case involves the Solver. Other actors included: Admin \\ \hline

Preconditions & Already have one solution submitted \\ \hline

Description of the Main Sequence & 1.	Go to Problems page and pick the problem  \newline  2. Press the Community solutions   \newline 3.	Solver scrolls and sees the ranking of solution (based on the time it took to run) \\ \hline

Description of the Alternative Sequence & 1.	Admin accesses the solutions without having to have submitted a solution beforehand \newline 2. Admin picks a solution \newline 3.	Admin can see all the solutionss the specifier Solver has ever provided \\ \hline

Non functional requirements & \- \\ \hline

Postcondition & \- \\ \hline
