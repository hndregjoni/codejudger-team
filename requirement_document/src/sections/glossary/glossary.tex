    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Problem}: The representation of one problem. A collection of testcases, a statement and some constraints
        \item \textbf{TestCase}: The elementary unit of data that is fed a program during evaluation
        \item \textbf{Contest}: A collection of problems, having constraint much like the same way
        \item \textbf{ConstraintSet}: An entity representating a set of constraints:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{TimeSpaceConstraint}: Specifies a time limit and a space limit per test case, during running
            \item \textbf{TimespanConstraint}: Specifies a time range within which the problem can be attempted (or the contest joined)
            \item \textbf{UserConstraint}: Specifies a limit to the user which can attempt the problem or join the contest
            \item \textbf{LanguageConstraint}: Specifies a limit to the languages usable.
        \end{enumerate} \\
        \textbf{NOTICE}: The Contest constraints shall override the Problem constraints

    \textbf{NOTICE}: There shall be a limit to the submissoins enqueued, capped by submissions per user at a time, submission per user per unit of time, total number of submissions and submissions per queue, all configurable
    \item \textbf{GIT}: The version control system. It shall be used for the management of each prolbem allowing for easier importing and exporting of problems using a GIT url.
