### Topics discussed:  
- Crystalizing our idea
- Dividing weekly duties
- Setting up the git repos.

<br>

### Decisions Made:

All the members were invited to become collaborators in the repository created specifically for the team related documentation (the one hosting this page). This repository also contains the wiki pages, that are used for reporting weekly duties and tasks completed by all the members of the group. This repo will also be used to host the different diagrams that will eventually be created. The tools to be used
for documentation were discussed, and some intial decisions were made. We will use:
1. git
2. Markdown
3. A combination of Mermaid and PlantUML for the diagrams

<br>

### Tasks Assigned:

Initially, some resources were shared for all the members of the group to approach an equal standing. The resources gave guides and descriptions of the following technologies (also listed above):
1. git
2. Markdown
3. Mermaid (optional)

As for the more individual assignments,the group was divided in two and the members were assigned a task according to the group they belonged in.  
The tasks were as stated below:  
1. Listing existing implementations , name and features (Besjana, Nika, Luis)
2. Listing features that our software might consist of or need (Hysen, Dario, Inis)
