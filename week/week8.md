### Decisions Made:
This week we decided upon the further diagrams that need to be made (those included several new Activity diagrams, and State diagrams). We also ran through the steps to set up a local development environment for those who are going to participate code. We also decided that we would keep working on the implementation (and as for the progress made, we finished a good portion of the application data model, and also a CLI tool for running problems.)
