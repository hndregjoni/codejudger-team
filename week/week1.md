### Topics discussed:  
- Introducing ourselves and skills
- Picking a leader 
- Project ideas
- Setting up the git repos

<br>

### Decisions Made:
We talked about various app ideas, some of which are listed below :
-	code contest
-	invoice app (targeting supermarkets)
-	online classroom platform 
-	game
-	public transport

As for the implementation phase of the softwareâ€™s life cycle, all the details will be handled using GitHub by all team members.
After we decided on the topic that was more appealing to everyone, which was the code contest app , it was unanimously decided for Hysen to be the leader.

Brief explanation of what the app is supposed to be about :

> Webapp targeting developers wishing to spend their time participating in solving problems, challenges and increasing their points in order to move up in the ranks.

### Tasks Assigned:

Since this was the first week, the tasks are not diverse.

Everyone, except the leader was assigned to gather information on source control.  
The leader, was responsible for opening the repository on GitHub and also the wiki pages for every member of the team. The entire team was occupied with finding the possible technologies that we could use on the project and the roles that a member would take.

Possible roles as of now are: frontend , backend, and database developing.
Although, as we also discussed in the classroom , the roles will be added or changed as the weeks progress. For example, one person would be in charge of the ER diagrams, another in charge of the workflow etc.
