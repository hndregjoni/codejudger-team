### Topics discussed: 
Primary discussion was concerning the development of our webapp.  
A demonstration of how the technologies that are being used was given by Hysen. Mostly things regarding the frontend, since the backend is solely done by Hysen. 
Another topic discussed were the diagrams that were expected of us , which were :

        - State diagrams 
        - remaining Activity diagrams
        - DFD 
        - Sequence diagram
        - Gantt chart
        - Class diagrams 

As mentioned also in the classroom , we have already done the Gantt chart.
As for the class diagrams, they are automatically generated since the approach we have chose a.k.a the ORM makes it posibble.

### Decisions Made:
<br>
It was decided that :  

-   Hysen will continue working on backend
-   Besjana and Nika will continue working on frontend
-   Hysen and Besjana will focus on DFD, Sequence diagrams
-   Nika and Dario will work on state diagrams

### Tasks Assigned:

    - Hysen is in charge of sketching and uploading the DFD,state and sequence diagrams
    - Besjana is in charge of frontend and also working refining the diagrams to make the uniform
    - Nika is partaking in the frontend and uploading state diagrams
