### Topics discussed:  

-   frontend 
-   backend

<br>

### Decisions Made:
<br>
It was decided that we would stray a little from the wireframes uploaded in the <em><strong>/sketches/ui/wireframes</strong></strong></em> folder.  

This decision regards only the Admin page and also the Contest page which was not made as a wireframe to begin with.  
Another decision is that by the end of the week we should have finished with the layout of the frontend  and also the <strong>MVP</strong>  (Minimum Viable Product).

### Tasks Assigned:
    - Hysen is in charge of backend and a little frontend.
    - Nika and Besjana are in charge of frontend
