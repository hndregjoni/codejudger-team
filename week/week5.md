### Topics discussed:  
- Progress so far
- Schedule for the upcoming weeks
- Difficulties of each memeber with their assigned task
- Working locally using git

(These are the same as last week)

We went over the progress pertaining to the assignments from last week, and also distributed some new tasks (mostly to do with the diagrams we need to get done.)

<br>

### Decisions Made:

- We will continue with the diagrams, improving on some of the previous weeks, but working on new ones as well (State and Activity).

- We will update the Trello boards, and also create another one for the implementation.

- _We_ decided a techstack:
  - *Language*: Python
  - *Framework*: Flask
  - *ORM*: SqlAlchemy
  - *DB*: Postgre


### Tasks Assigned:

We will be working on:

* Further wireframes (Besjana)
* State Diagram (Niki and Dario initially)
* Activity Diagram (Niki and Dario initially)
* Initiating implementation (Hysen)
