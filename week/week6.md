### Topics discussed:  
- Progress so far
- Schedule for the upcoming weeks (Trello)
- Requirements specification document
- Implementation details (frameworks)
- Diagrams 


### Decisions Made:
The meeting started with a brief explanation on how the implementation would be organized. Different from what was decided, the techstack has changed and the following is the final list :

    -   FastAPI (instead of Flask) for backend
    -   NuxtJS for frontend
    -   SqlAlchemy for ORM
    -   Postgre for database

### Tasks Assigned:

- Hysen took upon himself to __start building the structure__ of the web app.

- Besjana will check the work done by team members and make changes __if needed__.    
- Regarding __frontend__, at the moment Besjana (since she was also in charge of the wireframes) and Niki (which showed willingness) are the members responsible with the task.
- Luis is assigned to research on __security concerns__ regarding the execution of untrusted code.  
In a more elaborate sense, he had to see how technologies like **Docker** and **seccomp** can be used to __mitigate this risk__
