### Topics discussed:  
- Progress so far
- Schedule for the upcoming weeks
- Difficulties of each memeber with their assigned task
- Working locally using git

Since we get the tasks after we have the lecture in Friday, a progress check was done.	
The use-case diagram was referenced by the members who need to use it to complete the UC tables.	
Sketches and prototypes are a very individual process, and that needed no further discussion.
The more technical stuff, such as working locally on the repo and then pushing the changes were discussed for the members that were not too familiar with the concepts.

### Decisions Made:
A brief summar was offered to the team , which consisted of Trello boards and the Gantt chart (which Hysen did).

Trello is a kanban-style, list-making webapp.
Two boards are created to keep the work-flow going and without ambiguity.  
The first one called "___Management___" has the general tasks that need to be done.  
The second one called "___Diagrams___" has the specific diagrams such as:  
- sequence diagram 
- state diagram 
- activity diagram 
- ERD

The Diagrams board is up to date with the Management board.

> UC tables  
 
Niki and Dario are currently working on the use case tables (as discussed in the classroom during lecture)
This task proved to be a little time-consuming, hence the deadline was extended to be next week.

A Gantt chart to display the schedule of the project in a more readable way was done by Hysen.
It was decided that everyone check the chart.
With regards to the UI , hand-drawn sketches were done for pages (most of them , there might be some minor changes along the way).	
Besjana transferred these sketches(which she also drew) in the form of wireframes using Figma.
The deadline of the UI pre-processing part would be the end of next week, so when implementation starts the transition is smooth.

Last but not least, it was agreed that from then on we would organize the meetings in person , preferrably in a computer lab where we could also use the projector and the white board to better explain and communicate our ideas.

### Tasks Assigned:

Hysen will keep doing the managerial duties and also start working with the requirements specification document.  
Nika and Dario will work on the task of the previous week which are the UC tables.  
Besjana is assigned the UI , meaning the sketches and prototypes.  
Luis and Inis are assigned with finding possible scenarios that can be used to test the functionality of the judger that has been mentioned in the previous meeting report.
